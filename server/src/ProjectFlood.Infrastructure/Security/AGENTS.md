| `JwtPublicKeyCache.cs` | `JwtPublicKeyCache` | Fetches and caches platform-auth JWKS for JWT signature validation |
| `PlatformAuthClient.cs` | `PlatformAuthClient` | Resolves platform PID to internal uid through platform-auth |

## Symbols

|--------|------|------|

| `PlatformAuthClient.GetUserIdByPidAsync` | method | Returns null on lookup failure; caller maps to 401 |

## Rules
- Game server validates access JWTs statelessly with JWKS.
- Platform-auth owns refresh, logout, session-family state, and account identity.
